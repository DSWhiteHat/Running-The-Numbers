3200 Time Trial (Boys),8/16/2010,"Overcast & low-70s, but humidity was really high","This is a very promising start to our 2010 CCXC season!  We have tremendous depth and we have high quality depth; 12 athletes under 12:00 breaks the old record of 11 athletes in 2008.  I'm also very excited about the 1600 meter times...once you gentlemen develop the endurance to carry your speed for the duration of a 5k, it's going to be exciting!  Whether you had a ""GREAT"" day or just a ""GOOD"" day for the time trial, remember that this is only the start of our 2010 XC journey.  There is a lot of hard work to be done!  Commit yourselves to the daily process of becoming a great XC runner & TEAM and be a TEAM on a MISSION in 2010! STUDLY PERFORMANCES: BK, Bryce Ebersole, Devin Gill, Cody Lloyd, Dylan Nixon, Daniel Neiswender, Hunter Adams, Shaun Ditlzer, and I guess Alex Galli",,,

McCaskey & Annville-Cleona @ Lancaster Catholic (Boys),9/7/2010,Warm...Mid-80s...Dry & Dusty...Course ran slow,"Congratulations on beating a very good Annville-Cleona team and getting the 3 W's on a tough day.  Many of you raced tough today on a difficult day to compete.  These are the days that will make the great days that much better.  We have a strong team right now, but we have a lot of work to do before we get close to realizing our potential.  I challenge you to ALWAYS display your fitness level in races...nothing more & nothing less.  Some of you ran a race yesterday that was well below your current training level.  The mistake is in the past, so now you have to learn from it and make the adjustment and use it to FUEL YOUR FIRE for PennTrackXC on Saturday!  Do the little things the rest of this week to put you in position to be successful on Saturday.  ",Cedar Crest 15 - Lancaster Catholic 55,Cedar Crest 20 - J.P.

McCaskey & Annville-Cleona @ Lancaster Catholic (Girls),9/7/2010,Warm...Mid-80s...Dry & Dusty...Course ran slow,"Great start ladies...the 2010 CCXC GIRLS are UNDEFEATED!  Be happy with our great start but do not get complacent.  This was a good start for our team, but we have bigger and better competitions on the horizon.  I loved the confident TEAM SWAGGER that you showed before the race today and during the first part of the race.  For the most part you ran smart and strong races and moved up during the race.  If you aren't happy with your time today, don't worry about it.  Saturday you will have the opportunity to cut a HUGE amount of time off of today!  One thing that you really need to focus on improving is getting our post-race routine started shortly after our race is finished.  Other than that, great job and let's keep getting better!!!",Cedar Crest 23 - Lancaster Catholic 32,Cedar Crest 15 - J.P. McCaskey 52,Cedar Crest 15 - Annville-Cleona 52
