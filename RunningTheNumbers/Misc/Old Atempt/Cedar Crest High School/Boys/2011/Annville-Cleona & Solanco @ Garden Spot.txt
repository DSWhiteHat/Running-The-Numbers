…a very good start.  Let's shrink it to 30 seconds against Hempfield!
-I hope that you can appreciate the overall awesomeness of A71 cross country meet!  The combination of the weather conditions and this course combined to equal unforgettable racing conditions.  If you can run a strong race in these conditions, you can handle any XC course that you will run this year!  I love the way that you embraced the challenging circumstances and maintained a positive attitude about the race!
-Many of you are very STRONG runners right now!  Overall, we owned the last half of the race and finished really well because we were stronger and tougher than our competitors.  How do you become a STRONG runner?  You run a lot of miles, you do the extra strength training, and most importantly...YOU STAY MENTALLY STRONG FOR THE ENTIRE RACE!  Over the course of the season we will work on becoming FAST and STRONG, but for now...just focus on becoming a STRONGER runner each and every day!
-We have some awesome DEPTH and you know what they say about depth, don't you???  Now I don't want to focus on any team other than the Cedar Crest Falcons, so let's just continue to cash in on the PUSH & PULL mentality so that our entire TEAM is moving forward!  Every single runner has a role to play!  Make sure that you are doing your part for the TEAM!

Areas of Improvement:
-KNOW THE COURSE!  It's impossible to know where you are going to make the next move to break your opponent if you don't know where the course is going.  Now there were some very challenging circumstances today and it was the first meet, so let's just make sure that  we really know the course well next Tuesday!
-Don't overthink...just race!  Some of you psyched yourselves out and carried around unecessary tension for your race.  When you approach a race, just focus on ALWAYS demonstrating your fitness level...that's all you can do.  We don't need you to try and go out there with some superhuman effort...you just need to demonstrate your highest fitness level!
-Try to simplify your lives.  By all means, please be well-rounded teenagers that are excellent at everything that you do!  But, just remember that it is only possible to be excellent at so many different things.  If you burn a candle at both ends, soon you aren't going to have a very big candle any more.  Make sure that you are managing your time wisely and doing the little things because they make a huge difference!
-Running Shoes- Some of you are running in shoes that either have too many miles on them or aren't the best for your personal biomechanics.  You can get a good pair of running shoes for $50-$75...it's a small cost to stay healthy!


Hey CCXC, I have a question for you...

WHO'S NEXT?????
